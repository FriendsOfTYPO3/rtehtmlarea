Labels in the text formating drop-down list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the drop-down list, depending on RTE configuration, both, the label
and the tagname may be shown.

The label is important for those authors that do not know HTML, the
tagname is convenient for the coders and also for the HTML novices,
because this way they can learn their meanings and be enabled to use
the status bar.

For example, depending on configuration, we may have:

q – Quotation

or

Quotation – q

or

Quotation

Labels are always shown in the author's language regardless of the
content's language.

The default order is alphabetical but may be configured otherwise in
Page TSconfig.
