The open source htmlArea editor was originally developed by Mihai
Bazon and sponsored by
`interactivetools.com <https://www.interactivetools.com/>`_ . A number
of htmlArea extensions were contributed by various authors. Both the
base editor and the extensions have been substantially modified for
the purpose of this extension.

This extension is a continuation of the work initiated by Kasper
Skårhøj and Philipp Borgmann who
realized the initial integration using the RTE API introduced in TYPO3
3.6.0 as well as the initial integration of the TYPO3 image insertion
and link insertion wizards.

Thanks to Ursula Renziehausen from Universität Erfurt for her great ideas,
advice and patient support in improving multiple aspects or the RTE.

Thanks to Jan Wulff for analyzing the
issues related to Internet Explorer and mod\_gzip on Apache servers.

The icons of the anchor accessibility feature are provided by creator
and copyright-owner Cornelia Lange.

Thanks to Pierre-Yves Gadina for the
improved icons of the Insert Image button and of the Table Operations
tool bar and Ursula Renziehausen has further improved many of the
icons.

The initial toggleborders button logic and the automatic url and email
recognition logic originate from `Xinha <https://trac.xinha.org/>`__,
a fork of htmlArea.

Thanks to the people at `cablan.net <https://www.cablan.net>`__
for their help and support in understanding
and debugging the interfaces and configuration issues of the various
versions of Aspell.

When performing copy/cut/paste operations with Mozilla/Firefox, the
extension may trigger the installation of Mozilla/Firefox extension
"AllowClipboard Helper" developed by Petr Simek.

Thanks to Daniel Schwarzloh for contributing the
option for replacing typographical punctuation with ASCII characters
in the format removal feature.
