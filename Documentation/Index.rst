This extension provides a highly configurable rich text editor based on HtmlArea
for TYPO3 v8.

It was part of TYPO3 Core until 2017, where it was replaced by the CKeditor
(see `rte_ckeditor <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/rte_ckeditor>`__
extension), which has been the new standard since then.
